# Hierarchal-Object
Assignment was to create an object with 5 moving parts. Other requirements include :
* Must be able to move in 5 degrees of motion (using wasd keys)
* Must include textures/color so long as the object is not solid white/gray/black
* Must include two camera modes that can be toggled with a key switch
* Must include a dynamic shadow

## About
Packages used to create this project are not included in this repository (sig/sigapp which are products of Marcello Kallmann). This repository is for Project1 for Computer Graphics (CSE170) UC Merced Spring 2018.

## Known Issues
- [ ] Camera modes are not fully implemented
- [ ] Shadow flickers
- [ ] Too many calls for movement causes application to crash

### Note of Warning
Instructors are beginning to use [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) to catch cheaters. If you are a student looking here with the intent of copying this code, proceed with caution. Considering that this project in particular requires the creation of an **_original object_** (even if you load in premade models), it would be blatantly obvious if you use this code for reference, **HOWEVER**, using this as reference for rotations, transformations, ~~camera modes~~, and shadow implementation is perfectly fine.
